    <h2>What is The Array Between Numbers Generator and How Do You Use It?</h2>
    <p>
      The Prime Number Filter is a function that takes an array of numbers as
      input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the
      original array. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that
      is only divisible by 1 and itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can either type the numbers separated by commas or spaces, or you can
      provide the array.For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
      7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7]
